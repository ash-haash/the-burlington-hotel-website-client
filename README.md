# This a demo or practice NHS site. National Health Service of the UK website. For the learning perpose I tried to build a website like NHS.

# This is the live site demo, although for some unknown deployment reason some features are not working properly, on local host google login works properly and shows user name on the navbar, but after deploying to netlify it is not working properly. I tried hosting to firebase but it wasn't working. 

# Live Link: https://the-nhs-uk.web.app/

# The main focus was to learn and implement React Authentication with firebase, I implemented google login and email password login method. 

# I also used React Router in this project. User can visit to different routes without loading the site. This gives a smooth user experience.

# Private Route is also used in this project to protect some data from unauthorised users, to access this data or route user have to login to the system.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
